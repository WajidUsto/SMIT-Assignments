        <span>One sadden moment I read your poetry,<br>
          Deep with significant messages, got pity with my vocabulary,<br>
          What a wonderful legendary poem story created beautifully.<br>
          Bravo, hooray! , , , it hooked my heart amazingly,
          <br>
          <br>
          A mail links popped-up on my search out of the blue,<br>
          Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be,<br>
          Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece,<br>
          Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence.<br>
          <br>
          
          Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out,<br>
          Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt,<br>
          Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust,<br>
          Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet.</span>
